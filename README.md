# Static Express Site

A full stack project I built for my portfolio during my studies at [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com). In this project, I created a website to showcase the five previous projects I have built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page and a series of five project pages.

I created a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I have built, and used [Pug JS](https://pugjs.org/) to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I then used NodeJS and Express to -

- Import the required dependencies. 
- Link the JSON with the Pug templates.
- Set up routes to handle requests.
- Set up the middleware to use static files (like CSS files).
- Handle errors.
- Set up a server to serve the project.

## Quick Start

To run the app locally on your computer, you should have a code editor and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine.

[Download the ZIP file](https://github.com/zviels/static-express-site/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract it and open the project folder in your favorite code editor.

After that, open the terminal and run the commands `npm i` and `npm start`. 
To view the app leave your code editor open and visit `localhost:3000` in your browser.

Alternatively, you can watch the app online [here](https://static-express-website.herokuapp.com).

## Overview
